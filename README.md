# Professional Online Portfolio Website

**Welcome!**

To use my portfolio as a starting point to your own professional portfolio, follow the steps laid out here:

- Make sure to clone this repository into a directory of your choice.
- Next, open a new terminal and install dependencies using `yarn install`.
- To work on changes using hot reloading, make sure to open a development server using the command `yarn dev`

### To Recruiters and Hiring Managers

**Live Site:** https://williamlocke-portfolio.vercel.app

The site is mostly functional, so you are free to interact with everything you can!

Just a note: the contact form is not actually connected to a mail service, and therefore it won't send the message yet. That is a feature that I am currently working on!

Links to my socials and my resume can be found on both the top and the bottom of the live site.
